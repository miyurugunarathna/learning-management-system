## The Learning Management System - Aspire.
> Aspiration of Education Inspiration


Learning Management System (LMS) is a Web Application which connects the teachers and the students to perform online delivery of educational courses. It provides an all-in-one platform where teachers can deliver courses for which students can enroll. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to closure of Educational Institutions. This has affected not only the education of the students, but also the teachers and economy of the country. To provide a solution for this problem, we chose to develop an online Learning Management System to deliver courses online. The main importance of this platform is to generate income by providing educational services.
